This is my personal e-commerce website, it doesn't use for any e-commerce purpose. Free to clone and running in your local

There are fews functions:
<space><space>
-Information of products/Their categories 
<space><space>
-CRUD (Manage)
<space><space>
-Login/Logout/Register
<space><space>
-Decentralization
<space><space>
-Shopping Cart/Checkout
<space><space>

I will do some additional functions related to security(JWT/https) but it will be in another using Spring framework. Maybe AJAX and statistics will be added for my project.
